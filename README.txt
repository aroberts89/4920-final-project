-- Play Instructions

Open FinalProject.uproject in Unreal Editor and press play.

The goal of the game is to protect the core (located in the middle
of the arena) from being destroyed. The current health of the core is shown
on the HUD in the top left.

The game ends when either the core is destroyed or all the enemy
waves have been defeated.

Several waves of enemies will spawn from various spots in the arena.

The red balls scattered throughout the arena are speed powerups. Run
over them to temporarily increase your move speed.

The blue pads on the ground are jump pads. These can be used to
navigate the arena more quickly and to get to otherwise inaccessible
platforms.
